# Jarvis-GPT-Home-Assistant
Project which aims to create a smart home assistant based on ChatGPT.
 I plan to work solo
Jarvis: GPT Home Assistant
Description of Project
My project proposal is to develop, test, and create a Raspberry Pi-based smart home assistant that leverages the generative capabilities of ChatGPT to provide responses when spoken to. Ideally, this project will allow me to create a cheap and functional alternative to popular voice-activated smart home assistants such as Google Home and Alexa.

Core features: wakeup word to activate speech to text, ability to transcribe speech into text, input into LLM, and respond with text to speech to user.
Ideally will be implemented on a Raspberry Pi w/ mic in the final stage
Will leverage python libraries, open source STT software, OpenAI API, etc. 

I believe this project is worth pursuing because if successful will allow for the creation of a low cost smart home assistant which can be tinkered with and customized more than the ones currently on the market.

Resources
https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/

I do not have any datasets currently in mind. Perhaps finding a specific dataset to make the LLM more specialized (?)
Labs dealing with API usage and customizing the model will probably be helpful.

Deliverables
I plan to showcase a video showing the assistant functioning as intended, along with the code repository and tools used to create the project
Rough Timeline:
-Week 1: Brainstorming, coding and figuring out how everything will work with each other
-Week 2: Getting the project deployed onto a Raspberry Pi, setting up a possible local interface(?)
-Week 3: Testing/Modifications/Improvements
